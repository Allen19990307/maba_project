### Why Maintain a Happy Mood?

Humans are emotional beings, and the richness and fluctuations of our emotions add a lot of color and beauty to life. However, emotions can both support and hinder us. It's common to see examples of people troubled, disturbed, or hurt by their emotions. Therefore, we must continually grow in emotional management.

 The highest level of emotional management might be what Wang Yangming described as "a mind that remains unmoved, yet moves according to circumstances." This means not being easily disturbed or hurt emotionally. The mind should be as calm as a mirror, allowing tranquility to lead to far-reaching peace. The emotional fluctuations should not be too intense, frequent, or prolonged.

But does this mean we should become emotionless and lack energy? Wang Yangming added that we should move according to circumstances. When opportunities arise, emotions can be overwhelming and powerful, producing a surprising amount of energy. But how do we seize these opportunities? 

This requires wisdom. When we need to start something, we must get excited, mobilizing our entire energy to complete the task. This reminds me of a famous quote: "God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference." Achieving this requires long-term effort, which is why Laozi said, "He who conquers others is strong; he who conquers himself is mighty." Here, I can share a few simple concepts and methods.

#### 1. Controlling Amygdala Hijacking

The amygdala is the emotional center of the brain, crucial for human survival. In emergencies, there's no time to think; the human emergency response bypasses the brain, which is the amygdala being hijacked. This emergency response can mobilize all our energy in the shortest time to deal with sudden events, which is its positive side. But it can also lead to a loss of control. For instance, suddenly getting very angry and lashing out, only to regret it later. Or feeling deeply depressed after being scolded by a boss, a project setback, or a minor exam failure.

Such depression can lead to indulgence in certain activities, like playing games endlessly, binge eating, and self-blame or even self-hatred. How do we manage amygdala hijacking? Here are some simple methods:

- **Deep Breathing:** This is a crucial practice for calming emotions and managing amygdala hijacking effectively.
- **Self-Suggestion:** Since amygdala hijacking happens quickly, reportedly within six seconds, controlling this short period can prevent a loss of control. Repeating a positive mantra like "My life is infinitely wonderful" several times can be effective.

#### 2. Learn to Self-Excite and Actively Seek "Flow"

Flow is a state of being deeply immersed and finding joy in an activity. The world doesn't revolve around you; most people have to revolve around the world. You need to find ways to self-excite and constantly seek "spiritual opium" that motivates you to move forward. If you don't learn to self-excite, don't expect others to motivate you daily.

For many, everything seems too difficult. You need to constantly find small moments of happiness in daily life to encourage yourself to keep going, creatively. Most of us will never win an Oscar, Grammy, Emmy, Nobel, or Pulitzer. But small moments of happiness in life are everywhere. A fire in winter, a cold beer in summer, a kiss on the ear, finding a parking spot after searching for a long time, someone handing you a power bank when your phone is about to die, or a cool breeze after a sweaty climb in autumn. Ordinary people can still enjoy simple pleasures like burning incense, tasting tea, relaxing, listening to the rain, watching mountains, fishing, and trying new drinks. These wonderful moments in life are endless and inexhaustible.

Today's challenges demand high emotional resilience. Without enough toughness, you can't make it. Many people look glamorous on the outside but are miserable inside. Every family has its difficulties, explaining why so many people struggle to sleep, feel anxious and depressed, and even fall into depression. I make time to sing, play basketball, and work out to relax.

#### 3. Mindfulness Practice: Living in the Moment

Mindfulness is a form of breathing exercise that enhances our awareness and control over our thoughts. Our thoughts are constantly flowing, and we often daydream without realizing it. Studies show that during work, about 50% of the time, our minds are wandering. This might explain why many meetings are inefficient or even useless.

Mindfulness helps us focus on the present moment. While mindfulness is popular worldwide, especially in tech companies like Google, it is actually rooted in Eastern wisdom. The "Great Learning" in Confucianism talks about "sincerity of intention" and "rectification of the mind." Sincerity means being genuine, and rectification means focusing on the present, not being distracted or indifferent.

Studies have found that mindfulness can make us calmer and better at managing emotional outbursts. It can also improve our sleep, memory, attention, and even intelligence.
