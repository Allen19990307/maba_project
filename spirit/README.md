Why Should We Continue to Cultivate and Grow Spiritually?
As highly intelligent and spiritual beings, humans sometimes ponder the meaning of life. This question is akin to the one posed by a security guard at Peking University: Who are you, where do you come from, and where are you going? Another question is: Why do I live? Many people go through their entire lives without asking this question; many ask but never find an answer. Probably only a few people not only ask but also find the answer.

Does life have any meaning? From my current perspective, life has no inherent meaning! Although life has no inherent meaning, we can give our lives meaning.

One fundamental perspective is: Living itself is meaningful! However, this meaning seems too ordinary and not very appealing. A Western saying goes, "Live, and let live." This short phrase seems quite Zen-like. Some people only care about their own lives, living well but not letting others live or live well. Therefore, "live and let live" seems to be a rather noble life meaning.

Another Western saying is "Live, Love, and Learn," making the meaning of life the "3 Ls": live well, love well, and learn well. This sounds good too, suggesting that when I leave this world, I can say: I have lived, I have learned, I have loved! Perhaps we should add another word: play—I have played?

Chinese people have contemplated the meaning of life much earlier. Confucius starts the Analects by saying: “Is it not a pleasure to learn and practice what is learned in time? Is it not a joy to have friends coming from afar? Is it not gentlemanly not to be angered when people fail to recognize one?” According to Confucius, the meaning of life lies in three states: continuously learning and gaining new insights and deriving joy from it; having like-minded friends who travel far to see you, loving and being loved by them; and being a gentleman who reconciles with the world, remaining calm regardless of others’ understanding of you.

From another saying of Confucius, we can also infer his meaning of life: “At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning; at thirty, I stood firm; at forty, I had no doubts; at fifty, I knew the will of Heaven; at sixty, I was willing to listen to it; at seventy, I could follow my heart’s desire without overstepping the line.” According to Confucius, life requires continuous improvement, with major advancements in energy and state every ten years. Constant cultivation and upgrading may be the meaning of life, ultimately achieving a state of complete freedom of mind and behavior.

In the "Great Learning," a famous saying also reflects ancient Chinese sages' thoughts on life's meaning: investigating things, extending knowledge, making thoughts sincere, rectifying the heart, cultivating oneself, regulating the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world. From the Confucian perspective, the highest state of being in the world may be hidden in this phrase. I translate it as follows: study everything, continually gain new knowledge, be authentic, live in and enjoy the present, continuously improve oneself, manage one's family well, participate in national governance, and create a harmonious world.

What is the meaning of life? Wang Yangming's last words may best explain it. It is said that when his disciples asked if he had any last words, he replied: “This heart is bright, what more is there to say?” Perhaps for Wang Yangming, in a dark society, maintaining inner brightness and living with a clear conscience throughout one’s life is the purpose of life.

For most ordinary people, finding the meaning of life requires exploration, known in the West as "soul searching." Viktor Frankl, an Austrian psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor, developed a field called logotherapy to help people find meaning in life. Frankl proposed that those who survived the inhumane Nazi concentration camps did so because they had a strong vision for the future and a sense of meaning and purpose in life.

I have asked many students in my classes if they have thought about or figured out their life's mission or meaning and even written it down. Very few have done so, but many think it’s a worthwhile question. Christians often say, "God has a plan for me," suggesting that there is a divine plan for everyone that each person must try to discover.

Educator Tao Xingzhi said that life is for a great cause, and each person's great cause is unique. Li Bai said, "Heaven has endowed me with talents for eventual use," indicating that everyone’s talents and potential have a purpose.

These explorations can only be decided by each individual as to whether they are valuable and necessary. Ultimately, the answers to these questions can only come from within oneself. However, there are two sayings that have always influenced me and I would like to share with you: "Just Do It," and "Stay hungry, stay foolish."


为什么要在精神上、灵性上不断修炼、持续成长？ 人作为高级的有灵性的动物，有时会问关于人生意义的问题。这确实就像北大保安问的问题：你是谁，你从哪里来，要到那里去？ 另外一个问题就是我为什么而活。很多人一辈子都不问这个问题；问了但找不到答案的也大有人在。大概只有少数人不仅问了还找到了答案。人生到底有没有意义？以我现在的想法来看，人生是没有意义的！人生虽然没有意义，但我的人生我做主，我们能赋予自己的人生一定的意义。

一种底线思维就是：活着就是意义！但这个意义好像太普通了，一点也不性感。有西方人提出来，Live，and let live，自己活，也让别人活。这句短句好像很有禅意。有些人只顾自己活着，自己活好，但不让别人活，或者不让别人活好。所以，“自己活，也让别人活”，就似乎已经是一个相当崇高的人生意义了。另一个西方人说，Live，Love and Learn，这样就是3 L的人生意义，就是“好好活、好好爱、好好学”，这个听起来也不错啊，这好像是说，在我离开这个世界的时候，我可以这样说：我活过、我学过、我爱过！是否还应该加一个字：play，我玩过？

中国人对人生意义的思考肯定更早。孔子的论语开篇就说：“学而时习之，不亦说乎？有朋自远方来，不亦乐乎？人不知而不愠，不亦君子乎？”照孔子的说法来推测，他所设定的人生的意义藏在三种状态中：在持续学习中不断有新的领悟，并且乐从中来；你拥有志同道合的朋友，他们会长途跋涉远道而来看你，他们爱你，你也爱他们；成为君子，成为跟世界和解的君子，不管人家多么不理解你，你都能够保持平常心。

我们从孔子的另一段话中，似乎也可以揣摩出他为自己设定的人生意义：吾十有五而志于学，三十而立，四十而不惑，五十而知天命，六十而耳顺，七十而从心所欲不逾矩。从孔子的话来看：人生需要不断精进，每十年需要有一个大的势能的提升、境界的提升。持续修炼不断升级可能是人生的意义，最后要达到从心所欲不逾矩的境界，也就是心灵和行为获得完全的自由境界。

礼记大学中说的那段著名的话，也可以看成是中国古代圣人对人生意义的思考。格物、致知、诚意、正心、修身、齐家、治国、平天下。从儒家的观点来看，为人在世的最高境界，可能就藏在这句话里了。我把它翻译成以下几点：研究万事万物、不断获得新知、不装——做自己、活在当下享受当下、不断修炼自我精进、搞好小家庭带好小团队、参与国家治理、共创大同世界。

人生有什么意义？王阳明的临终遗言可能是最好的诠释了。临终前，据说他的弟子问他还有什么话要说，他回答道：此心光明，夫复何言。也许对王阳明来说，在一个黑暗的社会里，能一辈子保持内心光明，做到问心无愧，就是实现了人生的目的。

对于大多数普通人来说，找到自己的人生意义是需要探索的，就像西方人所说的那样，soul searching，灵魂的探索。有个奥地利精神病学家，也是纳粹集中营的幸存者维克多福兰克尔专门构建了一门学科，人生意义疗法，帮助人们寻找人生意义。Frank提出有人之所以能够从惨无人道的纳粹集中营生存下来，是因为这些人对未来有强烈的憧憬，同时拥有人生的意义和目的感。

我曾经在课堂上问过不少同学，有谁想过、或者想清楚了自己的人生使命或意义，甚至把人生使命写下来的。结果发现这样的人还真是非常少。但很多人觉得这是一个值得思考的问题。信仰基督教的人们常常说，God has a plan for me，上天对我是有计划有安排的，每个人自己要试图去探索出来这个安排是什么；
大教育家陶行知说，人生是为了一件大事而来，那每个人的这件大事又是什么；李白说，天生我材必有用，我们每个人的才能、潜能都会用在哪里。

这些探索，只能由我们每个人自己决定是否有价值，是否需要。最终，这些问题的答案也只能由自己给出，但有两句话一直影响我也想分享给你，Just Do It，说干就干；Stay hungry,stay foolish，求知若渴，求贤若愚。
