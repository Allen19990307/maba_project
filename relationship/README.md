## The Fourth of the Five Major Practices: Relationships

### Why Do We Need to Manage Relationships?

Many of life's joys, happiness, and pains stem from our social relationships. Numerous troubles, even mental and psychological illnesses, are triggered by social relationship issues. Social relationships include those with family, colleagues, friends, and others.

The three aspects we discussed earlier—physical, cognitive, and emotional—seem to be about ourselves. This is also part of the process of cultivating oneself to manage the family, govern the country, and bring peace to the world. However, the quality of social relationships is crucial to life. We could say that the kind of social relationships we have defines the kind of life we lead. Social relationships shape our lives.

In Chinese wisdom, the quality of social relationships is first attributed to oneself. If you don't handle your own issues well, you can't manage social relationships well, and you shouldn't blame others first. Therefore, if there are problems in relationships with your spouse, children, boss, subordinates, colleagues, friends, partners, or anyone else, you should first examine yourself. In reality, everyone has some issues with social interactions to varying degrees.

### Reviewing and Improving Social Relationships

Reflect on what the three most important relationships are for you, what problems exist, and why. If a social relationship is very important but in poor condition, it needs focused attention. These problems are usually tricky, so many people tend to avoid and procrastinate, burying their heads in the sand to escape the pain. Indeed, some things require time, and delaying might bring a turnaround. But one must be aware of the impact this has on our body and mind; often, we pay an extra price for avoidance or procrastination.

If a person examines their social relationships and finds that all of them are problematic, and they seem to be at odds with everyone, they must first consider where they themselves have gone wrong. The inability to reconcile with the world often stems from an inability to reconcile with oneself. Therefore, we need to reflect on why we cannot accept ourselves. Once we accept ourselves, we can start to accept the world. Continuous growth in the field of social relationships involves both macro and micro perspectives.

### Macro Approach: Strategic Thinking

The macro approach involves strategic thinking, regularly reviewing the characteristics and evolution of your social relationships, and proactively guiding the direction of these relationships. The differences between the networks of relationships that people actively build or passively form are significant. Each person’s network of relationships is like a small universe, and you should frequently ask yourself: Is my small universe becoming more active, diverse, and valuable to each node? At the same time, each person is also a node in someone else's network, a part of the larger universe. As a node in the larger social network, are you becoming more valuable to the entire network and universe, or the opposite? These questions require constant reflection.

### Micro Approach: Analyzing Each Important Social Relationship's Quality and Direction

From a micro perspective, analyze the quality and direction of each important social relationship. For example, the relationship with your boss. Everyone has a boss, even big bosses like Jack Ma and Ren Zhengfei. Some people think they don't have a boss, but realize who the boss is when it matters. This relationship with the boss troubles many people.

We often talk about managing our boss, and even management guru Peter Drucker wrote about "managing your boss," highlighting that this relationship is a crucial management issue that directly affects our success, growth, and happiness. On a macro level, regularly review your relationship with your boss. Ask yourself: Do I know what keeps my boss up at night? Do I know their top three priorities for the next three months? Do I know their preferred way of receiving information—face-to-face or through WeChat? Do we trust each other? Is our relationship close enough? Can I bring unique value to them? How should our relationship evolve, and what do I need to do?

In summary, the important social relationships in life, whether with your spouse or boss, are deep subjects on their own. On a micro level, I believe continuous growth in the field of social relationships involves three key points:

### 1. Enhance Empathy

What is empathy? Simply put, empathy is the ability to understand others cognitively and feel what they feel emotionally. It's the ability to guess someone's unspoken troubles, to feel what others feel even without experiencing their experiences. To cultivate empathy, start by learning to listen.

In the past, my mind was full of my own affairs, too cluttered to have the patience to listen to others. Sometimes, I would interrupt people after just a few sentences. Now, I often try to control myself and let others finish speaking, especially being aware of listening for the underlying meaning in their words. Of course, I haven't reached the level where every word is pleasant, and I can hear the hidden meanings, but I am constantly improving.

Listening involves more than just physically leaning forward and focusing on the speaker; it's about mental engagement. Westerners call it Active Listening, which conveys a similar idea. In addition to listening, observing is crucial. Most signals are conveyed through body language. Words can lie—saying you're happy when you're not, or willing when you're not—but body language is harder to fake. Often, due to pressure from the boss or social niceties, people say things they don't mean. We can catch these cues from expressions, especially posture, gestures, and eyebrow movements. A higher level of empathy involves embracing diversity.

The world is diverse, and this diversity brings beauty and innovation but also increases management complexity and costs. This is why many leaders are wary of diversity. However, in an era of innovation, future leaders must embrace, enjoy, and thrive in diversity.

### 2. Be Proactive in Expanding and Engaging

Social relationships need to be managed and built. Although my work has connected me with many people, I tend to be passive overall. As Murakami Haruki said, "Feelings fade if not maintained, and they disperse if not cherished. The world is vast, and I want to see it, not just the mountains, waters, and landscapes, but to connect with people and experience the beauty of different thoughts and personalities!" In the future, I want to be more proactive in building social relationships, mainly through initiating a study on entrepreneurs, a large-scale research project that will connect me with new people.

### 3. Follow the Principle of Reciprocity

In reality, unilateral giving or taking is unsustainable. Adam Grant, a renowned organizational psychologist at Wharton, studied how people give and take in organizations and society. He found that about 19% are pure takers, always asking, "What can he do for me? What can I get from him?" About 25% are givers, asking, "What can I do for you?" The remaining 56% are matchers, who believe in reciprocity—you help me, I help you.

Grant's research shows that the biggest losers are the excessive givers, who end up overwhelmed and unable to manage their own affairs. However, the good news is that the most successful are also givers who know their limits; they help others appropriately and ultimately achieve great success themselves. Society and organizations need to establish a culture of reciprocity. We help each other and don't let the givers suffer. As for those who only take without giving back, we should keep our distance and, if necessary, avoid them altogether.

为什么我们需要经营关系？

人生的许多快乐、幸福以及痛苦都是由我们的社会关系造成的。许多人的烦恼、甚至精神和心理疾病都是由社会关系问题触发的。社会关系包括了与家人、同事、朋友以及其他人的关系。

我们之前谈到的三个方面——身体、认知和情绪——似乎是关于我们自己的，这也涉及到修身齐家治国平天下的修身部分。但社会关系的质量对人生是非常重要的。可以说，我们有什么样的社会关系，就会有什么样的人生。社会关系定义了我们的人生。

在中国人的智慧中，社会关系的好坏首先要归功于或归罪于自己。自己没搞好，社会关系也搞不好，首先不要怪别人。因此，如果与妻子、丈夫、孩子、老板、下属、同僚、朋友、合作伙伴和其他认识或不认识的人在关系上出现问题，先要检讨一下自己。而在现实世界中，每个人多多少少都有一些社会交往方面的问题。

审视和改进社会关系
可以自己想一想，对你来说最重要的三个关系是什么，现在存在什么问题，为什么。如果某种社会关系的重要性很高，但状态又很不好，那就需要重点关注解决。这些问题通常比较棘手，因此很多人会采取逃避和拖延的方式，把头埋在沙堆里面，眼不见心不烦。确实，有些事情需要时间，拖一拖也许就会有转机。但当事人一定要觉察到这样做对我们的身心影响，我们常常需要因为逃避或拖延付出额外代价。

如果一个人对自己的社会关系进行了一番审视，发现自己的所有关系都出现问题了，好像与所有人都拧巴了，那首先要想的是自己什么地方出现了问题。与世界不能和解，首先是因为我们与自己不能和解。因此，我们需要沉思一下，自己在什么地方无法接纳自己，为什么不能接纳。我们接纳了自己，才能开始接纳这个世界。我们要在社会关系领域持续成长，有宏观和微观两个方面。

宏观方法：策略思考
宏观方法就是策略思考，经常性审视自己的社会关系的特点和演变过程，并主动引导各种社交关系的走向。每个人主动构筑或被动形成的关系网的差异很大。每个人自己所处的关系网就像一个小宇宙，需要常常自问自答一番：我的小宇宙变得更活跃、更多元化、对每个节点更有价值了吗？同时每个人又都是别人的关系网中的一个节点，是整个大宇宙中的一份子。作为大的社会关系网络中的一个节点，你对整个网络、整个大宇宙更加有价值呢还是相反？这些都需要常常审视。

微观方法：分析每个重要社会关系的质量和走向
从微观来说，就是要分析每个重要社会关系的质量和走向。例如，与老板之间的关系。我们每个人都有老板，包括那些大老板像马云、任正非。有的人以为自己没有老板，但事到临头才领悟到谁是老板。这种与老板的关系让很多人感到困扰。

我们常常说要管理好自己的老板，连管理大师德鲁克都专门写了“管理你的老板”的文章，可见管理与老板之间的关系其实是重要的管理问题，直接影响我们成功与否、成长与否、快乐与否。宏观上，要经常审视一下与老板的关系，多自问一下：我知道让老板晚上睡不着觉的事情吗？知道她未来三个月三项优先级最高的工作吗？知道她获得信息的偏好吗？比如说她喜欢当面说还是微信沟通就好？我俩互相信任吗？我们的亲密程度够吗？我能给她带来独特价值吗？未来我们的关系应该发生怎样的变化，我需要做什么？

总而言之，人生中那些重要的社会关系，不管是夫妻之间还是与老板的关系，都能独立成为一门学问。在微观层面，我觉得社会关系领域的持续成长要把握三点：
1. 提升同理心
同理心在认知上是能够善解人意，在情感上可以感同身受；能够猜准别人难言之隐，即使没有经历别人的经历，但能感受别人的感受的能力。要培养同理心，首先要学习倾听。

倾听的时候还需要注意观察，这是同理心中非常重要的技能。人的肢体语言透露出大部分的信号。语言可以骗人，不开心说成开心，不愿干说成很想干，但身体语言却不太会骗人。很多时候迫于老板的淫威，或者出于情面，说出一些违心的话，这些都是人之常情。但我们可以从别人的表情，特别是体态、手势、眉毛的运动中看出蛛丝马迹。同理心这种素质中，比较高的层级是接纳多元化。

世界是丰富多样的，不同的观点和方式造就了世界之美，人类之美。百花齐放百家争鸣，这是未来世界的特点。多样性带来了世界的丰富，促进了创新，但也增加了很多管理复杂性和成本。这是为什么很多领导者不喜欢多样性的原因。但在创新的年代，未来的领导者，必须接纳多样性、享受多样性、拥抱多样性，并在多样性中成长并灿烂。

2. 主动扩展，主动进攻
社会关系是需要经营和建设的。虽然因为工作关系我也认识不少人，但总体来说比较被动。村上春树说得好：“感情，不联系就会淡，不珍惜就会散。世界那么大，我想去看看，不只是看山看水看风景，还要多与人联接，体验不同的思想和个性之美！”以后我想在社会关系建设方面多一点主动扩展，主要通过启动一个创业者研究，一个较大规模的研究，在这个过程中，主动去联接以前没有联接过的人。

3. 遵循互惠原则
单方面付出或索取都是不可持续的。沃顿商学院著名组织心理学家亚当·格兰特对于组织中和社会上人们的付出和索取行为进行了研究。他发现：大约有19%的人是纯粹的索取者，他们遇到人就想“他可以帮我什么？我可以从他身上得到什么？”；大约有25%的人是给与者，他们会问“我能帮你做什么”；有56%的人是互利者，你帮我一些我帮你一些。

格兰特的研究发现：完全的输家是那些过度的给与者，因为他们慷慨地帮助别人但反而使自己焦头烂额，无暇顾及自己的事情。但好消息是最成功的也是那些把握分寸的给与者，他们总是能够恰到好处地帮助别人，最后自己也获得了很大的成功。整个社会和各类组织都需要建立互惠互利的文化，我帮你你帮我，不让雷锋吃亏。对于那些只求索取，不思回报的小人，我们也就只能点到为止，甚至敬而远之。
